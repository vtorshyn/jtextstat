1. Add support for human friendly command line options (in progress already) (!) (DONE)
2. Add UT body test (!!!)
3. Run various benchmarks with ThreadPool enabled solution. (..) (DONE)
- reader can executed in main thread since reading from file is well optimized already; 
- workers should parse read buffer, create own word map (DONE)
- on success workers should merge word map into global word map (DONE)
- required to play with readBuffer size: to small thread contention; to big - same performance as single threaded solution (DONE)
4. ApplicationOptions is not well designed. mandatoryOptions should be moved from ctor (..) (REFACTORED, DONE)
5. Move final map sort into separate task (!)
